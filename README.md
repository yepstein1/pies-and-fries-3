**Pies and Fries**

 A food ordering application to streamline the process of 
ordering pizza and french fries.
 The application is built using React in the front end and Node in the backend using Netlify functions for serverless  architecture.
 The app stores the order information in an Airtable database
 and sends out confirmation emails using Sendgrid. The 
 first working mode of this application just stored contact
 information to send a payment request to(via Zelle
 or Venmo) Currently I am working on implementing Stripe
 The old working version is at commmit 5b1ca71 on August 25.

**Pies and Fries**

 A food ordering application to streamline the process of 
 ordering pizza and french fries.
 The application is built using React in the front end and Node in the backend using Netlify functions for serverless  architecture.
 The app stores the order information in an Airtable database
 and sends out confirmation emails using Sendgrid. The 
 application accepts payments from the buyer using Stipe Checkout. (The  URL  for the site is https://pies-and-fries.netlify.app/)
